As a passionate and self-directed learner, I am dedicated to pursuing knowledge and self-improvement, and strive to make a positive impact on my community through sharing my practical experience and expertise. With a strong foundation in mathematics and a keen interest in data science, I am excited to pursue research and explore the latest developments and technologies in this field.

In addition, my competitive coding experience on Codeforces, participation in numerous online and offline contests, and attendance at 20+ webinars during the lockdown have helped me develop strong analytical and problem-solving skills.

I have honed my teamwork and leadership skills, working collaboratively with diverse groups to achieve shared goals.I involved myself in volunteer activities such as blood donation, philanthropic programs, and humanitarian efforts, I have demonstrated a commitment to creating a positive and magnanimous environment, both within my immediate community and beyond. I am excited to bring these skills and experiences to future endeavors and collaborate with others to achieve meaningful impact.
